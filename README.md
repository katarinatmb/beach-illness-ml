# Predicting Gastrointestinal Illness Severity from Beach Water Quality  
### Machine Learning Analysis Using the Santa Monica Bay Epidemiological Study  

This repository contains the machine learning models and analysis used to predict gastrointestinal (GI) illness severity among beachgoers based on bacterial contamination, environmental exposure, and demographic factors. The project uses data from the Santa Monica Bay Epidemiological Study but **the raw dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy restrictions**.

## 📘 Project Description

Recreational beach water contamination poses significant public health risks. Urban runoff introduces harmful bacteria into coastal waters, increasing gastrointestinal illness risk among swimmers. This project applies machine learning to understand how microbial water quality indicators relate to illness severity.

After extensive preprocessing, the dataset used for modeling contained **8,944 observations** collected from three California beaches—Santa Monica, Will Rogers, and Surfrider.

This repository includes:
- The full machine learning workflow in a Jupyter Notebook  
- Regression models predicting continuous GI severity  
- Classification models predicting high vs. low severity  

Due to data restrictions, **the notebook cannot be executed without the dataset**, but all model code, methodology, and workflow are fully visible.
